# hindom_results_analysis

The purpose of this code repository is to have a way to analyse the output file "convergence log" after running HINDOM code for a given DNS file. It consolidates the resulting values of matrix F to provide:

1. Malicious vs benign domain count
2. Results based on applying specific value of delta to the matrix F
